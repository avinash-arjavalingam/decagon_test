User: Hi there! I've been using StreamTask for a while now, and I have a suggestion for a new feature.

Support: Great, we'd love to hear it! What feature would you like to see added?

User: I think it would be really helpful if StreamTask had a built-in time tracking feature. It would make it much easier for me to keep track of how much time I spend on each task without having to use a separate time tracking tool.

Support: That sounds like a valuable addition indeed. Could you provide some more details on how you envision this feature working within StreamTask?

User: Sure! I imagine it would allow users to start and stop timers for each task directly within the StreamTask interface. It should also have the ability to manually enter time entries in case users forget to start the timer. And of course, it should provide reports and insights on how time is being spent across different tasks and projects.

Support: Thank you for sharing your idea! I'll make sure to pass it along to our development team for consideration. In the meantime, if you have any other suggestions or feedback, feel free to let us know.
