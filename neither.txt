User: Hello, I have a question about the pricing plans for CloudTask.

Support: Hi there! I'd be happy to help you with that. What would you like to know about our pricing plans?

User: I'm interested in upgrading my plan, but I'm not sure which tier would be the best fit for my needs. Can you provide some guidance on the features and pricing of each tier?

Support: Absolutely! Our pricing plans vary based on the features included and the number of users. We have a basic plan that includes essential features for individual users, a standard plan with additional collaboration tools for small teams, and a premium plan with advanced features and priority support for larger organizations. Would you like me to go over the details of each plan with you?

User: Yes, please. Also, do you offer any discounts for annual subscriptions?

Support: Certainly! We do offer discounts for annual subscriptions on all of our plans. The discount varies depending on the plan and the length of the subscription. Let me provide you with the details of the discounts for each plan.

User: Great, thank you for the information. I'll review the details and let you know if I have any further questions.
